Lock ID: `APCI-LEAN-AR0001-SOURCE-v1`  
Locked archive name: `Abstract_Physical_Certification_Impossibility_Run_0001.zip`  
Archive bytes: `53805`  
SHA-256: `4c889bb710defdde74c340a47182be31b59fe4c86fabaace403c9c3445420ff8`

The archive is the final independently audited
`Abstract_Physical_Certification_Impossibility_Run_0001.zip`. Its own audit
verdict is `PASS`; its own Lean status is `NO LEAN PROOF CLAIMED` because the
temporary WebAssembly checker did not complete. Both facts are preserved.

The archive itself is not published in this repository by default. Its exact
digest is recorded in `source/SOURCE_ARCHIVE.sha256`; the Lean statements and
their checks do not consume the archive as a build input.

Native CI run `31725279522` supersedes the archive's `FORMALIZATION_PENDING`
status for APC-T02, APC-T03, and APC-T04, and adds a typed machine-checked form
of APC-T01 with its total-decoder edge condition. It does not promote the
archive's open bridges or conditional physical interpretations.

No external source is needed for the elementary Lean theorems. The primary
physics and information-theory sources remain locked inside the archive and do
not become premises of the formal core.
